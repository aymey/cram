# Plans
heres kinda what i want to achieve:
- use image files as the source code (involving image elements such as colour, shapes, etc. with user defined meaning to all of these elements maybe in an image key file of some kind)
- be able to transpile to c and back
- compile from c to either x86-64 or a custom instruction set
- also an interpreter and some kind of an intermediate language
